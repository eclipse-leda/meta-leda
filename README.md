# OpenEmbedded Meta-Layer for Software Defined Vehicles components

This metalayer can be used to integrate software-defined vehicle open source components into a Yocto based build.

It is based on the guidelines documented in the [Yocto Project Documentation](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/3.1.13/brief-yoctoprojectqs/brief-yoctoprojectqs.html#creating-your-own-general-layer)

# Structure

- Eclipse Leda Quickstart Distribution: `meta-leda/meta-leda-distro`
- BSP for QEMU and Raspberry Pi: `meta-leda/meta-leda-bsp`
- SDV Component Recipes: `meta-leda/meta-leda-components`

Note: `meta-leda` is a [container layer](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/terms.html#term-Container-Layer).

# Usage

After cloning the repository, add the needed layers to your build configuration, for example:

    bitbake-layers add-layer meta-leda/meta-leda-components

Enable the `sdv` distro feature by adding the following line to your distro (or local) configuration:

    DISTRO_FEATURES:append = " sdv"

## Building using kas

The repository contains an example configuration (`.config.yaml`) for [kas](https://github.com/siemens/kas) . To build the image, simply run the kas build command:

    kas build
