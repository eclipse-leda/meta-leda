# OpenEmbedded Meta-Layer for Software Defined Vehicles components

This metalayer can be used to integrate software-defined vehicle open source components into a Yocto based build.

It is based on the guidelines documented in the [Yocto Project Documentation](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/3.1.13/brief-yoctoprojectqs/brief-yoctoprojectqs.html#creating-your-own-general-layer)
